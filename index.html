            <p>
              I would do my laundry in a laundromat late at night in south
              central Austin, Texas. I began to grow bored of the repitition I
              would endure upon arriving at the laundromat. I would simply wait
              for my clothes to wash or dry and scroll on my phone. I noticed
              everyone else would do the same thing. Throughout my time waiting
              I would recieve text messages, emails, and other forms of
              notifcations. I began to wonder how everything worked on my phone
              and the computer. I googled how an email went from one place to
              another and stumbled upon an article saying it was common for
              programmers to use php to logistically send emails. I bought a
              book on PHP and attempted to learn the process.

            <p>
              I had never seen a terminal before I went to school at The
              University of Texas at Austin. I wasn't aware that computers had
              such a thing. It was apart of the curriculum for us to learn how
              to install git properly and send our work to github. We had
              assignments that included branching and we would lock the
              repository and have conditions set to where we would need approval
              to push to the main branch. I enjoyed learning version control
              because it made a lot of sense to me to keep certain part of the
              software isolated from others.

            <p>
              Using Methodology and basic principles of software development,
              keeping things organized is easier said than done. Using a
              Github's Kanban board kept me focused and organized during the
              early stages of my career. When working with others we would
              design the Kanban baord to fit our needs to the group could stay
              on track. It let issues be known and each person could tackle the
              issue or one person could be assigned the issue directly. I saw
              how this could be helpful from a C.T.O's or C.E.O's standpoint at
              a company. It made the issues inside of the codebase seem ever
              more real and important. It also made the issues being
              accomplished feel recognized.

            <p>
              My instructor recommended we look at BitBucket and Jira among
              other tools that are alternative when learning how to program.
              Using Bitbucket was interesting because it gave a more visual
              effect to version control. I could see branch outright as opposed
              to having to use my imagination with github. Jira is the
              equivalent to a Kanban board on Github and set objectives and
              tasks out in a certain way. I enjoyed Jira because it simplified
              the Kanban board on Github.

            <p>
              I enrolled in an accelerated course at the University of Texas at
              Austin to learn more about web development and software
              engineering. I had written programs in php before attending the
              class so I had actually written HTML prior to knowing what it was.
              In order to generate PHP forms I needed to create a form in HTML.
              I would copy the php out of a book I bought at barnes and noble. I
              chose to try to learn PHP by myself and after seeing the
              complexity of programming I decided to reach out for help. To my
              dismay I found HTML and CSS to be very easy compared to what I was
              trying to accomplish with PHP.

            <p>
              After writing many projects in pure CSS I decided I wanted a
              unique way of making webpages look bright and different. I learned
              about SASS on the internet because the class I enrolled in did not
              teach it but I had heard about it from a classmate who had briefly
              used it. I re-wrote my first portfolio in SASS and had trouble
              deploying it to the web because it used a compiler which I was
              unfamiliar with. It turns out I had to use PHP to send it to the
              web statically. So My skill set had gone full circle. I began with
              learning PHP out of a book and throughout the course I found
              myself occasionally using PHP to help with other projects. I began
              to understand how technologies can work together in union.

              Engineering

            <p>
              I began Learning JavaScript at The University of Texas at Austin
              and remember being terrified because I had heard it was hard to
              program in general. Prior to learning javascript I had served
              sites statically using git and github, I had made forms go to
              certain email addresses, I had used fileZilla, domain-name
              services, and hosting services to put my work on the world wide
              web but I was still getting used to the logic and reasoning behind
              programming. It frightened me because I feel like no matter how
              hard I tried I couldn't absorb everything about the language in
              the time that I would put into it. It was at this moment I
              realized JavaScript is just like any other language, Spanish,
              Portugese, French, or Japanese. It takes time and patience.

              Engineering

            <p>
              Installing Nodejs and the usage behind backend theory was apart of
              the curriculum at The University of Texas at Austin. I was oddly
              more comfortable with the backend of software because when it
              worked it worked and when it didn't... well it didn't. The
              forgiving language that JavaScript is led me to believe that all
              things on the front end would be like the backend. Using Nodejs
              helped me understand the seperation of powers of software.
              Learning how to use nodejs was a powerful moment for me because I
              began to use all the technologies I had learned prior to nodejs,
              with nodejs. It was my first instance of developing server side
              technology.

            <p>
              A vast topic brought to me by The Unviersity of Texas at Austin.
              When we use services (especially free services) we have to play by
              their rules and in order to accomplish certain tasks this means do
              exactly what the documentation says. I learned about API's while
              implementing a map into an application/website I was building for
              fun. Using Geolocation I wrote a line of code that would use the
              users location to show businesses in the area of the user. I would
              store the user's location in Local Storage to better serve them
              the next time they came to website. Using the users location and
              Google Places API I would concatenate data together in order to
              retrieve information from the API.

            <p>
              After Learning Node I learned about node package modules and how
              close knit and powerful the javaScript community is. I had always
              wondered how every technology I was using was free to use. Open
              Source Projects are one of the many wonderful things having to do
              with software. Expressjs helped keep the server side of my
              websites and applications organized and managebale. I was able to
              see how a company would want to use certain technologies to keep
              order and structure in the codebase. Using Expressjs I crafted
              servers with minimal lines of code, created my own restAPI's from
              Scratch, and served my work off my own machine so I could view the
              front-end and instances of the backend at different locations,
              such as my restAPI at a different port, or a webpage specified to
              a certain user.

            <p>
              Working with Big Data is by far my favorite part of programming. I
              like the control that writing SQL gives me. The first Database
              system I learned how to use was Google's Firebase. It was assigned
              in curriculum at The Univerity of Texas at Austin to implment
              firebase in a project to store user input aswell as content from
              our own restAPI. After Learning why it was important to know how a
              database worked in the grandscheme of things I began to learn
              mySQL on my own time and learn the SQL that came with working with
              large data sets. After Learning mySQL, I learned MongoDB for
              school to create full stack applications to better suit the
              applications I had already built. PostgreSQL was my favorite
              database system to learn because it could handle large amount of
              data very quickly and the UI that came with the database similar
              to mySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, offered a visual representation of
              what was happening while I was writing SQL.
